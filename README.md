# Java-Sort_Array_First2_Last2
This Java program sorts the first two and last two elements of an array while keeping the rest unchanged. It takes user input for the array size and elements, extracts the first and last two elements, sorts them, and reinserts them into the original array. The program demonstrates array manipulation, sorting logic, and user input handling in Java.
